This guide shows you how to create, use, and manage Agent Skills in Claude Code. For background on how Skills work across Claude products, see [What are Skills?](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview). A Skill is a markdown file that teaches Claude how to do something specific: reviewing PRs using your team’s standards, generating commit messages in your preferred format, or querying your company’s database schema. When you ask Claude something that matches a Skill’s purpose, Claude automatically applies it.
