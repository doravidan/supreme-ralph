The [Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) gives you the same tools, agent loop, and context management that power Claude Code. It’s available as a CLI for scripts and CI/CD, or as [Python](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/python) and [TypeScript](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/typescript) packages for full programmatic control.
